## About Me

Hello! I currently working as a junior data scientist for PHSA (the BC Center for Disease Control). I have been enjoying applying machine learning methods to healthcare data. I currently am interested in and working on Graph neural networks (GNN's) particularly GraphSAGE and Graph Attention networks, and am exploring how to improve their performance in unsupervised and semi-supervised tasks. I am also currently open to new opportunities, and would love to expand my knowledge-base and apply my skills in data science and machine learning!

Before this, I was a Masterâ€™s student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca), supervised by  [Dr. Gabriela V. Cohen Freue](https://gcohenfr.github.io). I worked on a penalized multinomial model to predict the survival of patients given competing risks. The coefficients of the model were estimated using stochastic variance reduced gradient descent (SVRD), and the model achieved a 12 % improvement in performance compared to typical survival analysis models.

Previously I was an undergraduate student at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca) majoring in Biology and Mathematics.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, listening to music, reading books, working on art and playing tennis 


## Work Experience


Previously, I worked as a Data Science Intern at [Broadstreet HEOR](https://www.broadstreetheor.com). My favourite project to date involved working on partial least square regression models to select an appropriate composite measure of survey response scale item variables for estimating treatment effects.

I also worked as a Data science intern at BC Cancer, as part of the [Huntsman lab](https://www.bccrc.ca/dept/mo/labs/huntsman-lab), where I worked on analyzing different kinds of next-gen genomic data, including RNA-Seq, WGS, targeted panel data and scDNAseq to identify insights pertaining to ovarian cancers. I additionally worked on the development of an R package, meant to be a toolkit for the analysis and visualization of shallow-whole genome sequencing data. I developed a machine learning model (isolation forest) for the package to evaluate the quality of relative copy-number calls for shallow-whole genome sequencing data.

Prior to those positions, I worked as a Data Science intern at [JMIR Publications](https://jmirpublications.com), where I worked as part of the marketing and communications team on competitive bibliometrics analysis, and enhancing journal Google Ad campaigns largely through keyword extraction and topic modeling.
