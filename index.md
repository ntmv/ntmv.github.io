## About Me

Hello! I am a second year Statistics Masterâ€™s student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca), supervised by  [Dr. Gabriela V. Cohen Freue](https://gcohenfr.github.io)

Previously I was an undergraduate student at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca) majoring in Biology and Mathematics, where I completed my honours thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Ian Dworkin](https://dworkinlab.github.io), which involved working to develop [angler](https://github.com/ntmv/angler), an R package to compute standardized statistical measures and standard errors for sexual shape and size dimorphism. I also worked as a research assistant in collaboration with the Merritt Lab on a meta-analysis of genetic background effects.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, listening to music, reading books, working on art and playing tennis 

## Research Interests

- Sparse variable selection methods (regularization) applied to high-dimensional genomics data
- Competing Risks Analysis

## Work Experience

I am working as a Statistician Intern at [Broadstreet HEOR](https://www.broadstreetheor.com). My favourite project to date involved working on partial least square regression models to select an appropriate composite measure of survey response scale item variables for estimating treatment effects.

I also worked as a Bioinformatics intern at BC Cancer, as part of the [Huntsman lab](https://www.bccrc.ca/dept/mo/labs/huntsman-lab), where I worked on analyzing different kinds of next-gen genomic data, including RNA-Seq, WGS, targeted panel data and scDNAseq to identify insights pertaining to ovarian cancers. I additionally worked on the development of an R package, meant to be a toolkit for the analysis and visualization of shallow-whole genome sequencing data. I developed a preliminary sample quality tool to evaluate the quality of relative copy-number calls for shallow-whole genome sequencing data.

Previously, I also worked as a Data Science intern at [JMIR Publications](https://jmirpublications.com), where I worked as part of the marketing and communications team on competitive bibliometrics analysis, and enhancing journal Google Ad campaigns largely through keyword extraction and topic modeling.
